"# Binary tree  Traverse" 


Unlike linear data structures which have only one logical way to traverse/visit them, trees can be traversed in different ways. Following are the generally used ways for traversing trees.

a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) 
b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) 
c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root)

" #Algorithm Inorder(tree)"
   1. Traverse the left subtree.
   2. Visit the root.
   3. Traverse the right subtree. 
" #Algorithm Preorder(tree)"
   1. Visit the root.
   2. Traverse the left subtree. 
   3. Traverse the right subtree.

" #Algorithm Postorder(tree)"
   1. Traverse the left subtree. 
   2. Traverse the right subtree.
   3. Visit the root.
